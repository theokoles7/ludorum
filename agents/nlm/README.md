# Neural Logic Machine

Neural Logic Machine (NLM) is a neural-symbolic architecture for both inductive learning and logic reasoning. NLMs use tensors to represent logic predicates. This is done by grounding the predicate as True or False over a fixed set of objects. Based on the tensor representation, rules are implemented as neural operators that can be applied over the premise tensors and generate conclusion tensors.
